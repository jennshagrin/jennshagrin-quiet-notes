# About Jenn Shagrin

Hi ‚Äî I'm **Jenn Shagrin**, a cybersecurity and information technology professional
building systems that merge technical resilience with creative clarity.

I‚Äôm currently studying at **California Institute of Applied Technology (CIAT)**,
where my coursework spans **network defense, AI fundamentals, and blue-team operations**.
Before transitioning into tech, I co-founded the nonprofit **Crumpled Thoughts**, 
focused on teaching digital, communication, and tech literacy to students and communities.

I maintain this quiet corner of the web to document what I‚Äôm learning ‚Äî
from *Hack The Box labs* and *CompTIA certifications* to reflections on 
ethics, equity, and neurodiversity in the technology field.
